### Code-Quiz
---
---
In thsi challenge i had to make a quiz to set you on your JS and it was more work than i had thought.
I came into this thinking that there would be only a few if then statements and some objects with the questions, which to be fair thats all it is but there is way more logic involved than i had thought.
something that i got to use was the Display None property and i had a tutor show me how to use it and i loved it.
